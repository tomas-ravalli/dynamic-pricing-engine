# Modeling â€“Extended

This document provides a detailed overview of the modeling strategy, design choices, and performance metrics for the FCB Dynamic Pricing project. The goal is to move beyond a manual, intuition-based pricing approach to a data-driven, semi-automated system that optimizes for revenue while respecting business constraints.

## 1. Modeling Approach: A Two-Stage Framework

The core of the system is a two-stage process that first **predicts** demand and then **optimizes** for the best price based on that prediction. This decoupling allows for greater accuracy and flexibility.

### Stage 1: Demand Forecasting ðŸ“ˆ

The first stage answers the question: *"At a given price, how many tickets are we likely to sell?"*

* **Model**: A `GradientBoostingRegressor` is used to forecast ticket demand (`zone_historical_sales`) for each match at various potential price points.
* **Rationale**: Gradient Boosting was chosen for its ability to handle complex, non-linear relationships between features and its robustness against outliers. The EDA revealed that ticket price is driven by a mix of factors with varying scales and distributions, making a powerful model like Gradient Boosting a good fit.
* **Features**: The model uses a rich set of features, including:
    * **Internal Factors**: Historical sales, opponent tier, days until the match, and real-time ticket availability.
    * **External Factors**: Social media sentiment, search trends, and competing city events to capture market dynamics.
    * **Price**: The `ticket_price` itself is a key input feature, allowing the model to learn price elasticity.
 
The Simulation Engine

| Aspect | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Purpose** | To power the 'Impact Simulation' feature for "what-if" analysis by the commercial team. |
| **Question Answered** | "If I set the price to X, what is the likely impact on sales and revenue?" |
| **Core Function** | Takes a hypothetical price and match features as input, and uses the trained Demand Forecast Model to predict the outcome, providing an instant, data-driven preview of any potential pricing decision. |

### Stage 2: Price Optimization ðŸ’¹

The second stage uses the demand model to answer the business question: *"What is the single best price to set to maximize total revenue?"*

* **Model**: A custom **Optimization Engine** performs a grid search over a range of valid prices.
* **Rationale**: A grid search is a straightforward and effective way to find the optimal price within a defined set of business constraints (e.g., price caps and floors). It simulates the outcome for each price point and selects the one that yields the highest projected revenue.
* **Process**:
    1.  The engine iterates through a range of potential ticket prices (e.g., from â‚¬75 to â‚¬350 in increments of â‚¬5).
    2.  For each price, it uses the trained `GradientBoostingRegressor` model to predict the number of sales.
    3.  It calculates the projected revenue (Price Ã— Predicted Sales) for each price point.
    4.  The engine then returns the price that results in the maximum projected revenue.
 
The Optimization Engine

| Aspect | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Purpose** | To proactively generate the official `Price Variation Proposal`. |
| **Question Answered** | "What is the single best price to set for this seat to maximize our total revenue?" |
| **Core Function** | Operates by performing a grid search across a range of valid prices defined by business constraints. For each price point, it simulates the revenue using the demand model and returns the price that yields the highest projected revenue. |

## 2. Key Metrics & Performance

The success of the modeling approach was measured by both its predictive accuracy and its business impact.

| Metric             | Model               | Value  | Description                                                                                                                            |
| :----------------- | :------------------ | :----- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **RÂ² Score** | Demand Forecast     | **0.86** | The model explains 86% of the variance in the test set, indicating a strong predictive performance.                                    |
| **Revenue Uplift** | Optimization Engine | **+9%** | An average revenue increase per match, validated through controlled A/B testing against a static pricing model.                      |
| **Sell-Through Rate**| Optimization Engine | **+6%** | The model improved stadium occupancy by balancing revenue maximization with price elasticity, avoiding overly aggressive pricing that could lead to empty seats. |

## 3. Design Choices & Trade-offs

Several key decisions were made during the modeling process:

* **Model Selection**:
    * **Choice**: `GradientBoostingRegressor`.
    * **Alternatives Considered**: Linear models were considered but were not able to capture the complex, non-linear relationships revealed in the EDA. Deep learning models were also an option but would have required more data and a more complex MLOps pipeline.
    * **Trade-off**: Gradient Boosting offered a good balance of performance and interpretability without the high overhead of more complex models.

* **Feature Engineering**:
    * **Choice**: A combination of `StandardScaler` for numerical features and `OneHotEncoder` for categorical features was used.
    * **Rationale**: The EDA showed that numerical features had vastly different scales, justifying the need for normalization. The strong relationship between categorical features like `zone` and `opponent_tier` and the ticket price made one-hot encoding a natural choice.

* **Optimization Approach**:
    * **Choice**: Grid search within the Optimization Engine.
    * **Alternatives Considered**: More advanced optimization algorithms like Bayesian optimization could have been used.
    * **Trade-off**: While a grid search can be computationally intensive, it is exhaustive and guarantees finding the best price within the specified range. Given the business context, this reliability was prioritized over computational speed.

## 4. Potential Improvements & Future Work

While the current model is highly effective, there are several avenues for future improvement:

* **Real-time Feature Integration**: Currently, the models run on a daily batch schedule. Integrating a real-time feature store would allow for more responsive pricing based on intra-day changes in demand signals.
* **Personalized Pricing**: The model could be extended to offer personalized prices based on user segments (e.g., season ticket holders, first-time buyers). This would require more granular data but could lead to further revenue uplift.
* **Incorporate Causal Inference**: Use causal inference techniques to better distinguish the impact of price changes from other confounding factors (e.g., a star player's injury).
* **Advanced Optimization**: Explore more sophisticated optimization algorithms that can handle more complex business constraints, such as ensuring a certain level of occupancy in specific zones to improve the stadium atmosphere.
