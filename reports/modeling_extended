| **Purpose** | To power the 'Impact Simulation' feature for "what-if" analysis by the commercial team. |
| **Question Answered** | "If I set the price to X, what is the likely impact on sales and revenue?" |
| **Core Function** | Takes a hypothetical price and match features as input, and uses the trained Demand Forecast Model to predict the outcome, providing an instant, data-driven preview of any potential pricing decision. |

### The Optimization Engine

| **Purpose** | To proactively generate the official `Price Variation Proposal`. |
| **Question Answered** | "What is the single best price to set for this seat to maximize our total revenue?" |
| **Core Function** | Operates by performing a grid search across a range of valid prices defined by business constraints. For each price point, it simulates the revenue using the demand model and returns the price that yields the highest projected revenue. |
