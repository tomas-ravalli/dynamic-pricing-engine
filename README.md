| ü§ù Recommendation Adoption | **91%** of Proposals Approved | Measures the percentage of automated price proposals that were reviewed and approved by the commercial team, indicating trust in the model's business alignment.|
| üéØ Demand Forecast Accuracy | **14%** Weighted Avg. % Error | The demand forecast model's predictions have a low average error rate, indicating that sales predictions are reliable.|

## Overview

The diagram below illustrates the project's conceptual framework. The system acts as the central "brain" to balance the goals of The Club and The Fan. It operates in a continuous loop by ingesting internal data (like seat availability) and external factors (like social media buzz) to forecast demand at various price points. The **Decision Engine** then uses this forecast to recommend an optimal price. This transforms a static, manual pricing strategy into a responsive, automated system with a human-in-the-loop (HiTL), creating a market-driven approach for both setting and responding to ticket prices.

The core challenge was to move from a rigid, manual pricing strategy to a data-driven, automated one. The table below summarizes the problem‚Äìsolution mapping.

| üö© The Problem | üí° The Solution |
| :--------------------------- | :---------------------------- |
| **Static pricing**: Prices were set once per season in rigid, inflexible categories (e.g., A++, A, B). | **Dynamic recommendations**: Generates price proposals for each seating zone based on real-time data analysis. |
| **Manual adjustments**: The team would slowly analyze various metrics to manually propose price changes. | **Impact simulation**: Instantly models the projected impact of any price change on revenue and ticket sales. |
| **Data bottleneck**: Extracting data manually from fragmented systems was slow and operationally complex. | **Centralized data**: Automatically aggregates all key data points‚Äîsales, web analytics, contextual data, etc.‚Äîinto one place. |
| **Slow implementation**: The process to act on a decision was manual and disconnected from the sales platform. | **Seamless integration**: Allows for one-click approval on a dashboard, which triggers a price update to the live ticketing system via REST API. |


## Architecture

The general workflow is as follows:
1. **Data Sources** are collected and fed into the central engine.
2. The **Dynamic Pricing Engine** uses machine learning models and business rules to generate a price recommendation.
3. The pricing team uses the **UI & Integration** layer to review, simulate, and approve the price, which is then updated in the live ticketing system.

## Modeling

With data in hand, proceed to train the model. This phase includes selecting and training the model and conducting error analysis.

- Select and train a model using the prepared dataset.
- Conduct error analysis to identify improvement areas.
- Iterate on model architecture, hyper-parameters, or data as needed.
  
The modeling strategy followed a two-stage process: first *predict*, then *optimize*. The system first forecasts demand with high accuracy and then uses that forecast within a Decision Engine to find the optimal price.

### Stage 1: üìà Demand Forecasting

This stage answers the question: *"At a given price, how many tickets are we likely to sell?"*

| Aspect         | Description                                                                                                                                                                             |
| :------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Model** | A `GradientBoostingRegressor` forecasts ticket demand (`zone_historical_sales`) for each match.                                                                                           |
| **Rationale** | Gradient Boosting excels at handling the complex, non-linear relationships discovered during EDA and is robust against outliers, making it a strong choice for this task.                  |
| **Features** | The model uses a rich set of internal and external factors, including historical sales, opponent tier, social media sentiment, and the `ticket_price` itself to learn price elasticity. |
| **Application**| This trained model powers the **Simulation Engine**, allowing the commercial team to perform "what-if" analysis by inputting a hypothetical price and instantly seeing the likely impact on revenue and sales. |
| **Design Choice**| While `XGBoost` or `LightGBM` are often faster and would probably provide a performance edge, the choice of scikit-learn's `GradientBoostingRegressor`, because of the synthetic dataset size, the difference would be negligible. |

<details>
<summary><b>Click to see the detailed model performance evaluation</b></summary>

The primary goal is to accurately predict ticket sales. Performance was evaluated against a **baseline model** (`DummyRegressor`) to ensure the model was genuinely learning. The key metric chosen was **WAPE**, as it provides a clear, interpretable measure of percentage error that resonates with business stakeholders.

| Metric                        | Value           | Description & Rationale                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| :---------------------------- | :-------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **WAPE** (Primary Metric) | **14%** | **Why we chose it:** Weighted Absolute Percentage Error is the most critical metric for this business case. It tells us the average forecast error in percentage terms, making it highly interpretable for revenue planning. A low WAPE is our main goal. |
| **R¬≤ Score** | **0.86** | **For model fit:** This shows that the model explains 86% of the variance in ticket sales, confirming it has a strong statistical fit to the data and learns the underlying patterns effectively.                                |
| **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** | **~254 tickets**| **For business context:** MAE tells us that, on average, our forecast is off by about 254 tickets. This gives stakeholders a concrete sense of the error margin in absolute units.                                      |
| **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**| **~312 tickets**| **For robustness:** RMSE penalizes larger errors more heavily. A higher RMSE relative to MAE suggests the model occasionally makes larger prediction errors, which is useful information for risk assessment.             |

The performance was considered *successful*. A WAPE of 14% and an R¬≤ of 0.86 demonstrated a robust and reliable forecasting engine.

### Stage 2: ‚öôÔ∏è Price Optimization

This stage answers the business question: *"What is the single best price to maximize total revenue?"*

| Aspect         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| :------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Model** | A custom **Optimization Engine** performs an exhaustive grid search over a range of valid prices.                                                                                                        |
| **Rationale** | A grid search is a reliable and straightforward method to find the optimal price within defined business constraints (e.g., price caps and floors). It guarantees finding the maximum projected revenue. |
| **Process** | The engine iterates through potential prices (e.g., from ‚Ç¨75 to ‚Ç¨350), uses the demand model to predict sales for each, calculates the projected revenue (Price √ó Predicted Sales), and returns the optimal price. |
| **Output** | The engine's primary output is the official `Price Variation Proposal`, which is sent to the commercial team for review and approval.                                                                   |
| **Design Choice**| Bayesian Optimization would likely find a near-optimal price much faster by intelligently exploring the price space. However, it doesn't guarantee finding the absolute maximum. Guaranteeing the optimal recommendation (within the model's predictive power) is often more valuable than the computational speed gained from a heuristic approach. |

<details>
<summary><b>Click to see the detailed model performance evaluation</b></summary>

Since this is an optimization engine, not a predictive model, its performance is measured by its business value and efficiency.

| Metric            | How We Measure It                                                                                              | Success Criteria                                                                                        |
| :---------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Revenue Lift** | Through A/B testing (simulated or live), comparing the revenue generated by the engine's prices against a control group (e.g., prices set manually or by a simpler heuristic). | A consistent, statistically significant increase in average revenue per match.                               |
| **Adoption Rate** | Tracking the percentage of `Price Variation Proposals` that are reviewed and approved by the commercial team.    | A high adoption rate (>80%) indicates that the team trusts and values the engine's recommendations.         |
| **Computation Time**| Measuring the wall-clock time it takes for the grid search to complete for a given match.                       | The time must be within acceptable operational limits (e.g., under 1 minute) to allow for rapid, on-demand analysis by the commercial team. |

### Feature Engineering

The model's accuracy is heavily dependent on a rich feature set combining internal and external data.

* **üè† Internal factors**: one, two, three
* **üåç External factors**: four, five, six

A key part of the modeling strategy was to move beyond our internal sales history by enriching our models with external data. Through feature engineering, we combined our own historical performance data with real-world market signals‚Äîlike opponent rankings and social media hype‚Äîto create a more holistic and predictive view of market dynamics.

<details>
<summary><b>Click to see the detailed list of features</b></summary>

Each row in the synthetic dataset (`synthetic_match_data.csv`) represents the state of a specific seating **zone** for a single **match** at a particular point in time, defined by the `days_until_match`. The primary goal is to predict the `ticket_price` based on the other features.

| `opponent_tier` | String | A categorical rating of the opponent's quality and appeal (`A++`, `A`, `B`, `C`). Higher tiers signify more attractive matches, influencing demand. |
| `weather_forecast` | String | The predicted weather for the match day ('Sunny', 'Cloudy', 'Rain'). Can influence last-minute purchase decisions. |
| `competing_city_events` | Boolean | `True` if there are other major events (concerts, festivals) in the city on the same day, which could reduce local demand. `False` otherwise. |

### Time-Based & Demand Signals

These features capture the dynamics of demand over time and external market interest.

| Feature Name | Data Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `days_until_match` | Integer | The number of days remaining before the match. A key feature for time-series analysis, as demand typically increases as the match date approaches. |
| `flights_to_barcelona_index`| Integer | A synthetic index (scaled 20-100) representing the volume of inbound flights to the city. This serves as a proxy for tourist demand. |
| `google_trends_index` | Integer | A synthetic index (scaled 20-100) representing public search interest for the match on Google. A proxy for general public interest and hype. |
| `internal_search_trends`| Integer | A synthetic count of searches for the match on the club's own website or app. A direct signal of purchase intent from the user base. |
| `web_visits` | Integer | A synthetic count of visits to the ticketing section of the club's official website. A measure of online traffic and interest. |
| `web_conversion_rate` | Float | The synthetic conversion rate on the website (ticket purchases / visits). A measure of how effectively web traffic is converting into sales. |
| `social_media_sentiment`| Float | A synthetic score representing the overall public sentiment (e.g., from -1.0 for very negative to +1.0 for very positive) about the match on social media platforms. |

### Sales, Availability & Pricing

| Feature Name | Data Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`zone_historical_sales`** | **Integer** | **(Target Variable)** The historical number of tickets sold for a similar match in that zone. This is the *primary target variable* for the demand forecast model. |
| `zone_seats_availability` | Integer | The absolute number of seats still available for purchase in that zone. |
| `ticket_availability_pct` | Float | The percentage of total seats in the zone that are still available. |
| `competitor_avg_price` | Float | The average ticket price for a comparable entertainment event (e.g., another major football match, a concert) on the same day. Represents the competitive landscape. |
| `ticket_price` | Float | The price of the ticket. This is a *key input* feature for the demand model and the *final output* of the optimization engine. |

</details>

> **Notes on Deployment**
> - *Validation*: Before a full rollout, the system was rigorously validated through controlled A/B tests. The new dynamic pricing model was applied to a few sections of the stadium, with the rest serving as a control group. This allowed us to scientifically prove the model's positive impact on revenue and sales.
> - *Rollout*: The entire system was deployed within an automated MLOps pipeline. This ensures models are automatically retrained on new data, performance is constantly monitored, and price recommendations are reliably fed to the Control Panel. All models were designed for batch prediction, running on a daily schedule to balance cost and timeliness.
