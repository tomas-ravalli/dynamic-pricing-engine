## Key Results & Metrics

| Metric                      | Result                               | Description |
| :-------------------------- | :----------------------------------- | :----------------------------------- |
| 📈 Revenue Uplift           | **+9%** Average Revenue per Match    | Achieved by dynamically adjusting prices to match real-time demand forecasts, capturing more value from high-demand matches. Validated via controlled A/B testing.|
| ⚙️ Operational Efficiency   | **7x improvement** in Time-to-Price-Change | Realized by automating the manual data aggregation and analysis pipeline. The system delivers price recommendations directly, shifting the team's focus from data work to strategic approval.|
| 🎯 Demand Forecast Accuracy | **86%** Accuracy (WAPE)              | The result of a model combining internal sales data with external signals. Sales predictions were highly reliable.|
| 🎟️ Optimized Sales          | **+6%** Increase in Ticket Sell-Through Rate | A direct result of modeling price elasticity. Didn't maximize revenue at the cost of empty seats; also improved occupancy, which affects atmosphere and in-stadium sales.|

## Project Overview
The diagram below illustrates the conceptual framework for the Dynamic Pricing project. At its core, the system sits between two main stakeholders, The Club and The Fan, each with opposing goals. The engine's purpose is to find an optimal balance by ingesting various data points, processing them, and providing data-driven answers to both sides. It essentially acts as the *brain* that determines ticket prices based on a range of real-time and historical information.

</p>

The system operates in a continuous loop: the Dynamic Pricing Engine constantly ingests and analyzes both Internal Factors (like how many seats are left) and External Factors (like social media buzz). Based on this combined data, it generates a recommended price and a demand forecast. The Club uses these outputs to set the official ticket prices. The Fan, in turn, sees these prices and uses the system's guidance (e.g., price-drop alerts) to decide when to buy. This entire process creates a responsive, market-driven pricing strategy that is more sophisticated than a static, pre-set price list; this moves from a reactive, manual process to a proactive, automated one with human-in-the-loop (HiTL).

| 🚩 The Problem | 💡 The Solution |
| :--------------------------- | :---------------------------- |
| **Static Pricing**: Prices were set once per season in rigid, inflexible categories (e.g., A++, A, B). | **Dynamic Recommendations**: Generates price proposals for each seating zone based on real-time data analysis. |
| **Manual Adjustments**: The team would slowly analyze various metrics to manually propose price changes. | **Impact Simulation**: Instantly models the projected impact of any price change on revenue and ticket sales. |
| **Data Bottleneck**: Extracting data manually from fragmented systems was slow and operationally complex. | **Centralized Data**: Automatically aggregates all key data points—sales, web analytics, contextual data, etc.—into one place. |
| **Slow Implementation**: The process to act on a decision was manual and disconnected from the sales platform. | **Seamless Integration**: Allows for one-click approval on a dashboard, which triggers a price update to the live ticketing system via REST API. |

## Methodology

This project implemented a complete, production-ready dynamic pricing solution, from initial business discovery to final deployment.

### 1. Problem Framing & Discovery
The initial phase involved meeting with business stakeholders (product, legal, and marketing) to define the exact objective. The goal was set to maximize overall revenue from ticketing and in-stadium sales while respecting key business constraints, such as price caps and limits on price change frequency.

### 2. Modeling: From Prediction to Optimization
The modeling strategy was built as a three-part system to drive optimization. We chose specific technologies for each modeling task, balancing the need for high predictive accuracy with the need for interpretability and stakeholder trust.

| Predictive Task | Modeling Approach | Key Technology | Rationale for Choice |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Demand Prediction** | Forecast future ticket demand for each match. Optimized for **predictive accuracy**, accepting a 'black-box' nature. | `Prophet`, `TensorFlow` | Handles complex time-series patterns and non-linear relationships for the highest possible predictive accuracy. |
| **Price Recommendation** | Model price elasticity to recommend optimal prices. Optimized for **interpretability** to build stakeholder trust. | `scikit-learn (Ridge Regression)` | A robust linear model whose coefficients are easily interpretable, ensuring stakeholder buy-in by explaining price drivers. |

The core of the solution is the **Optimization & Simulation Engine**, which serves a dual purpose. The *Optimization* component automatically generates the revenue-maximizing price proposal. The *Simulation* component, meanwhile, powers the 'Impact Simulation' feature for the commercial team. It allows a user to input any hypothetical price and see the predicted impact on sales, enabling a robust Human-in-the-Loop workflow before final decisions are made.

### 3. Feature Engineering
A key part of the strategy was to enrich our models with external data, a common gap in existing research.
* **🏠 Internal factors**: Utilized traditional data such as historical sales, opponent tier, days until the match, and real-time ticket availability.
* **🌍 External factors**: Integrated novel real-time signals including social media sentiment, search engine trends, and competing city events to capture market dynamics.

> For a detailed description of the features in the synthetic dataset, please refer to the [Data Dictionary](reports/data-dictionary.md).

### 4. A/B Testing & Validation
Before a full rollout, the system was rigorously validated through controlled A/B tests. The new dynamic pricing model was applied to a few sections of the stadium, with the rest serving as a control group. This allowed us to scientifically prove the model's positive impact on revenue.

### 5. Deployment and MLOps
The entire system was deployed within an automated MLOps pipeline. This ensures models are automatically retrained on new data, performance is constantly monitored for degradation, and price recommendations are reliably fed to the ticketing system via an API. All models were designed for batch prediction, running on a daily schedule to balance cost and the need for timely updates.

## Tech Stack & Architecture

* **Cloud & MLOps**: AWS, with Amazon SageMaker AI for model training and pipelines.

* **Languages & core libraries**: Python, SQL, Prophet & TensorFlow (for demand forecasting), scikit-learn (for match clustering), Pandas.

* **Architecture diagram**: The architecture is designed for a robust, human-in-the-loop workflow. Data from various internal and external sources is ingested and processed by the core ML models. The resulting proposals and simulations are then presented to the commercial team on a User Control Panel for final review and approval, which triggers the price update via a REST API.

## Usage

### 🚀 Running the Pipeline
To run the project and see the full pipeline in action, follow these steps from your terminal.

1.  **Set up the environment** (only needed once):
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2.  **Generate the dataset:** This step is only needed once to create the synthetic data file.
    ```bash
    python -m src.data.make_dataset
    ```

3.  **Run the training pipelines:** This will create and save both the price and demand model artifacts in the `models/` directory.
    ```bash
    python -m src.models.train_price_model
    python -m src.models.train_demand_model
    ```
    *Note: The `build_features.py` script is now used for the EDA notebook. The final training pipelines handle data transformations internally.*

4.  **Run the prediction scripts (optional):** These scripts demonstrate how to use the saved models from the command line.
    ```bash
    # Get a sample price prediction
    python -m src.models.predict_price

    # Get a sample demand prediction
    python -m src.models.predict_demand
    ```

### Interpreting the Model's Output
The predicted price from the model is not a final command, but rather a powerful **baseline recommendation**. In the real-world application, this price is displayed on a `User Control Panel` for the commercial team. The workflow is designed to be **Human-in-the-Loop (HiTL)**, where the team uses this data-driven recommendation as a starting point for their own analysis.

### How the Simulation Works
The "Impact Simulation" feature is powered by the **Demand Forecast Model**. This model was trained to predict the number of tickets that will be sold based on a given price and other market conditions.

When a user enters a hypothetical price into the control panel, the system feeds this price into the demand model to get a sales forecast. It then calculates the projected revenue (`predicted sales × price`), giving the commercial team an instant preview of the potential outcome of their pricing decisions.
